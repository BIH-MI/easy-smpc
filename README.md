# Secure Histograms via Email

This project aims to provide a simple, easy to use application for calculating
sums of distributed data using email as a communication channel.

As email provides no safeguard for a faithful protocol execution, we aim to
provide GUI safeguards to help executing the protocol.

To provide information theoretic security it uses Arithmetic Secret Sharing on
the Field (2^127-1) (being the 12th mersenne prime) and provides security for
(signed) values up to 2^126-2.

This project is partly financed by the "Collaboration on Rare Diseases" of the
Medical Informatics Initiative, funded by the German Federal Ministry of
Education and Research (BMBF).
